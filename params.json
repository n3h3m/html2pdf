{"name":"Html2pdf","tagline":"Pure Python HTML/CSS to PDF converter","body":"*********\r\nxhtml2pdf\r\n*********\r\n\r\nHTML/CSS to PDF converter based on Python\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n=====\r\n\r\n``xhtml2pdf`` is a html2pdf converter using the ReportLab Toolkit,\r\nthe HTML5lib and pyPdf. It supports HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS 3).\r\nIt is completely written in pure Python so it is platform independent.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit of this tool that a user with Web skills like HTML and CSS\r\nis able to generate PDF templates very quickly without learning new\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n#. `Reportlab Toolkit 2.2+ <http://www.reportlab.org/>`_\r\n#. `html5lib 0.11.1+ <http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/>`_\r\n#. `PyPDF2 1.19+ (optional) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPDF2>`_\r\n\r\n   All requirements are listed in ``requirements.txt`` file.\r\n\r\nDevelopment environment\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nPython, virtualenv and dependencies\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Install Python 2.6.x or 2.7.x. Installation steps depends on your operating system.\r\n\r\n2. Install Pip, the python package installer::\r\n\r\n    sudo easy_install pip\r\n\r\n   For more information about ``pip`` refer to http://www.pip-installer.org/.\r\n\r\n3. I will recommend using ``virtualenv`` for development. This is great to have separate environment for\r\n   each project, keeping the dependencies for multiple projects separated::\r\n\r\n    sudo pip install virtualenv\r\n\r\n   For more information about ``virtualenv`` refer to http://www.virtualenv.org/\r\n\r\n4. Create virtualenv for the project. This can be inside the project directory, but cannot be under\r\n   version control::\r\n\r\n    virtualenv --distribute xhtml2pdfenv --python=python2\r\n\r\n5. Activate your virtualenv::\r\n\r\n    source xhtml2pdfenv/bin/activate\r\n\r\n   Later to deactivate use::\r\n\r\n    deactivate\r\n\r\n6. Next step will be to install/upgrade dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` file::\r\n\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n7. Run tests to check your configuration::\r\n\r\n    nosetests --with-coverage\r\n\r\n   You should have a log with success status::\r\n\r\n    Ran 36 tests in 0.322s\r\n\r\n    OK\r\n\r\nPython integration\r\n==================\r\n\r\nSome simple demos of how to integrate xhtml2pdf into\r\na Python program may be found here: test/simple.py\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nDevelopment for this software happend on github, and the main fork is\r\ncurrently at https://github.com/chrisglass/xhtml2pdf\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome in any format, but using github's pull request\r\nsystem is very highly preferred since it makes review and integration\r\nmuch easier.\r\n\r\nRunning tests\r\n=============\r\n\r\nTwo different test suites are available to assert xhtml2pdf works reliably:\r\n\r\n#. Unit tests. The unit testing framework is currently minimal, but is being\r\n   improved on a daily basis (contributions welcome). They should run in the\r\n   expected way for Python's unittest module, i.e.::\r\n\r\n        nosetests --with-coverage (or your personal favorite)\r\n\r\n#. Functional tests. Thanks to mawe42's super cool work, a full functional\r\n   test suite lives in testrender/.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* IRC: #xhtml2pdf on freenode\r\n* Mailing list: xhtml2pdf@googlegroups.com\r\n* Google group: http://groups.google.com/group/xhtml2pdf\r\n\r\nMaintainer: Chris Glass <tribaal@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright 2010 Dirk Holtwick, holtwick.it\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
